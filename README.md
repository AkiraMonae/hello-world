# hello-world
Just a practice
To future Akira,
  Start practicing more about webdevelopment and design so you can build expeirience for a job! Be good enough to make a nice website for yourself :]..and other people of course. Then maybe you can get enough money to buy your self a kiln to creat things using clay to sell and then sing covers on youtube :D
  
  LEARN INSTRUMENTS TOO, they are fun ....
